A CLI tool for fetching lyrics of a song

## Why?

I thought it was inconvenient having to open chrome everytime I wanted to find a
song's lyrics, so out of laziness I made this which if we're realistically
talking probably doesn't even save much time.

## Use:

When opening the tool, just type in the song name when prompted, and the artist
if you can remember when prompted. Can't remember the artist? No worries, it'll
suggest songs with names and hopefully you'll recognise the artist's name.
